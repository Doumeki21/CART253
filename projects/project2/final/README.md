SUMMARY

My final project aims to bring attention to individuals who are pressured by time and tend to overwork themselves in the end. In most cases, this “time” or rather “deadline” is a self-deception and a psychological stress.

ARTISTIC AND TECHNICAL GOALS

The feeling of pressure is achieved by giving a short 10 seconds for each game. The consistent control of the mouse is intuitive yet offers a diverse range of procedures to complete the game. Despite the intuitive controls, this unpredictable series of events that change abruptly also adds up to the pressure. In the artistic sense, the intense colors of magenta and red add to the tension as well. At the same time, the flat background narrows the player’s focus to complete the level while disregarding anything else. (This is similar to how I often overlook my surroundings and only focus on my tasks.) Furthermore, the complexity of the human is represented by abstract visuals, which are simple shapes that allow the player to interpret the meaning of the game as they wish.

After a round of 7 games, the player would find themselves facing a black screen, followed by siren sounds and a heart monitor beeping in the background. This event indicates a moment of unconsciousness (from burnout) and an attempt at recovery at the hospital. From here, the final interactive event prompts the player to reflect and draw something they care about. This event allows them to step back and take a breather, free from the fast-paced society. Finally, the game ends with the quote by William Churchill, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal”. The game leaves a final message for the player; to forgive themselves and respect their limits.

BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS

From this project, I was able to explore the use of strings and classes more in-depth. Other than using classes for object-oriented programming, I also used it as a tool to organize my states into games and regular events. By creating 2 parent classes, I can use the “chain of inheritance” method to link the appropriate events into their parent classes.
Furthermore, I was able to randomize the games by listing the classes as strings inside an array and linking the strings with their class names. That way, I was able to group specific classes (aka. the games) into an array that tracks the maximum number of games to randomize before breaking out of the loop.
